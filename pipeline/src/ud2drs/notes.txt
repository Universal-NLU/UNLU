- more fine grained origin index (see the conjunction rules) 

we probably want to implement some lightweight FUs that can be passed to navigateByRelation as follows (NB: no feature matching, just relations; though the relation can be "mother")

navigateByRelation tp [T.pack "obl", T.pack "det"]

The problem is then how to deal with situations where there is no or multiple matches. navigateByRelation throws an error. Do we want to default to the current node?

Currently implemented with Maybe monad, but NB that we want *global* uniqueness, i.e. "conj cc" is ok even if there are several conj daughters, as long as only one of them has (only one) cc daughter.




- offset marks show up in "named" constraints because the built into the lemma finding function!
